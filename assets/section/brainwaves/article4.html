			<p>	The ongoing investigation of Chinese grad student Yingying Zhang’s disappearance <br> continues as the suspected kidnapper, Brendt Christensen, has been arrested and <br> taken in for questioning by the FBI..</p>
			<p>	According to authorities, the FBI no longer believe Zhang is alive based on a confession <br> by the suspect while he was under surveillance last Thursday, in which Christensen <br> described how he kidnapped Zhang.</p>
			<p>	Christensen is a grad student of the University of Illinois, the same school that Zhang<br>was last seen at. According to a UI Professor, Christensen had no previous educational<br> or behavioral issues and had been a teaching  assistant in the physics department until <br>this past May.</p><br>
			<p>	During earlier stages of the investigation, FBI agents and police officers obtained a<br>warrant to search Christensen’s vehicle, which matched the one shown in street<br>security footage. At the same time, the authorities interviewed Christensen at the<br>bureau’s Champaign office.<br>While conducting the interview, the suspect admitted to picking Zhang up at the place<br>shown in the security footage, but claimed to have dropped her after driving a few<br>blocks. Another occupant of Christensen’s residence consented to a search and seizure<br>of the residence, during which the investigators found the suspect’s phone was<br>collected.<br>Upon searching the cellphone, investigators found that Christensen had visited a fetish<br>website with articles titled “Abduction 101” and “planning a kidnapping.”<br>Christensen made his first appearance at the federal courthouse in Urbana, Illinois on<br>Monday the 3rd. During his entire  nine-minute appearance, the accused remained<br>nearly silent and did not enter any plea.</p>
			<p>Students and professors at UI, as well as sympathetic strangers, held a rally for<br>Yingying Zhang’s family. Oddly enough, Brendt Christensen attended the rally for his<br>victim, as shown in a photo taken from CNN.<br>The day following the rally, Christensen, who had already been under surveillance for<br>several weeks, was arrested.<br>
			Christensen now faces a federal kidnapping charge, and, if convicted, could be<br>sentenced to life in prison. According to the suspect’s lawyer, Christensen has no<br>criminal history and it is unknown whether he will declare his innocence or not.<br>There are conflicting opinions from China, particularly the many students from the<br>country who travel to the United States to attend school. While many are concerned<br>about Zhang’s disappearance, many others are still unshaken, citing China’s own high<br>rate of violent crimes.<br>Members of Zhang’s family who had travelled to the States to assist in the search for<br>her have been informed of Christensen’s arrest.</p>
